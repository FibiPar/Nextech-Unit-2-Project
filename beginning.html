    <p> Florida Governor Ron DeSantis signed the Stop W.O.K.E. Act in 2022, which prohibits any lessons or training that teaches individuals are inherently racist or sexist because of their race or sex and that people are privileged or oppressed due to their race or sex. The law constricts how topics like slavery and racism can be taught. </p>
       <p>It even goes as far as teaching a false narrative by claiming “the experience of slavery was beneficial to African Americans because it helped them acquire skills.” </p> <p>DeSantis believes that critical race theory, defined in the legislation as "the theory that racism is not merely the product of individual bias but that racism is systemically embedded in American society," teaches “kids to hate each other.” </p> 
       <p>He finds no ill in educating inaccurate material about history to nurture tolerance for America's participation in racist acts in hopes that it will not offend the descendants of those involved.</p>
